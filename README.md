# Gradient Evasion Attacks

This repo is my reimplementation of the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.06131). Initial mindset is to code the theory from Biggio et al. including but not limited to the gradient attack algorithms, classifiers and experiment runs. Hope to expand on this work by adding some experiments of my own or optimizing the attacks mentioned in this paper if time permits (or if I don't get distracted by another paper).

Starting out with reading the paper in full and note-taking as I go...
